# Mintlify Documentation Website (HTML & CSS)

This project is a desktop-first recreation of the Mintlify documentation website.
It was built as part of the Web Dev Cohort 2026 HTML & CSS assignment.

The goal of this project was to match the structure, layout, typography, and
overall visual appearance of the original website as closely as possible using
only HTML and CSS.

## Notes

- This project is desktop-only as required by the assignment.
- No JavaScript or animations were used.
- Layout accuracy and visual similarity were prioritized over responsiveness.
- Images and icons are similar to the original Mintlify website.
- The navigation bar does not change style on scroll, as this behavior requires JavaScript, which was not allowed for this assignment.
